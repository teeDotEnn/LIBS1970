## Week 4.5: Social Comparison

### Sources of self knowledge

#### Social comparison theory

We are naturally inclined to comapare outselves to others. Festinger(1954) proposed that humans compare themselves in social settings to establish a benchmark of where we should be. 

There are several types of social comparison: 

    - Similar
        - Believes that others are the same as us
    - Upward 
        - comparing ourselves to those we think are better than us
    - Downward
        - Comparing against those we think are worse than us
        
#### Why do we engage in social comparison?

According to Wood (1989) There are 3 reasons we engage in social comparision
- Self Evaluation
    - This is an accuracte assessment of ourselves, usually comparing ourselves to a similar person
- Self Improvement
    - This evealuation allows us to learn how we can improve. Compare self to those in better circumstances
- Self Enhancement
    - This type of evaluation helps protect our self esteem. Comparing selves to others in worse situations

### Comparisons are subliminal and automatic

- Flash image study
    
    In an interesting study (Stapel & Blanton, 2004) looked at how we compare ourselves and the impact this has on self-perceptions. Researchers flashed college student’s pictures on a computer screen for 110 milliseconds. In case you don’t know how fast that is, it’s too fast to consciously notice the pictures' content. Next, the researchers showed half the participants pictures of a baby girl, and the other half were showed pictures of an elderly woman.

    Interesting, they found that when these students were asked to rate themselves in terms of relative age (young to old), those who viewed the baby picture rated themselves as older compared to those who saw the pictures of the elderly woman!

### Comparison and social rank

- Social rank theory
    
    Researchers have developed a theory of social competition (Price, Sloman, Gardner, Gilbert & Rohde, 1994). This theory outlines how we compete for popularity and attractiveness. We know that for young people especially, popularity is more important than other social factors (Lansu & Cillessen, 2012). At the end of the day, if they aren’t ranked highly by peers, they are more prone to depression.

    Younger individuals are affected even more by social comparison via social media because they typically use social networking site more often. In addition, they use social media to develop their identities (Correa, Hinsley & DeZuniga, 2010; Robins & Trzesniewski, 2005). Therefore, for young people, the feedback received specifically via social media is very salient in developing their sense of self.

### Social comparison and Social media

#### Facebook
    

    One study found that 74% of young teenage females reported that their peers use social media to “make themselves look cooler” (Fardouly, Diedrichs, Vartanian & Halliwell 2015). As Essena O’Neil said, “my pictures online served no real purpose other than self-promotion” (no author, 2015). It may be the case then that as we engage in more self-presentation online, we also engage in more upward social comparisons.

    Researchers have also looked at how social comparison relates to feelings of envy (Blease, 2015; Fox & Moreland, 2015). Findings suggest that upward (and more negative) social comparisons are highly related to feelings of envy. When stressors associated with social media were assessed, results showed that painful social comparisons and envy were the more frequently reported negative outcomes of using Facebook. At the end of the day, what this all suggests is that the more we use Facebook (and compare our lives to the lives of others on Facebook), the more unhappy we become!

    In line with this idea, research has shown that envy and negative comparisons can actually cause depression (Nesi & Prinstein, 2015). One study found that females who spent more time on Facebook felt worse than those who simply surfed the web. Connections between social media use and body image are also evident. Sadly, people who compare themselves to others online more often, also report more facial, hair and skin deficiencies.

#### Selfies

    Think about any public place you have been recently. How often have you seen someone take a selfie, or a picture of themselves using their mobile device? I can bet that it’s at least a few times. With photo based sites such as Instagram, it’s no wonder that people are so motivated to take photos of themselves at every opportunity! This has even motivated manufacturers to sell “selfie sticks” so that people can take the most optimal photos.

    This obsession with the self is not new. In fact, it you think back to County Fairs in the past or even malls, there were photo booths where you could pay a dollar and have a strip of selfies taken. The latest craze is photo booths at weddings where guests can have selfies taken dressed up in various props.

    When it comes to researcher selfies and how we evaluate our own photos, we know that people are mostly happy with how they look (Chae, 2017). People edit their selfies because they want to look at least the same, or even better than others online. In fact, findings show that even good looking people will edit their pictures to achieve perfection!

#### Pintrest

    Did you know? 42% of mothers have 'Pintrest Stress'
    
    In a survey conducted by today magazine (Dube, 2013), 7000 mothers were asked about how they feel when using Pinterest. Just under half said that they worry that they are not a “crafty of creative” as they should be. This site makes others feel that life should be magazine perfect: Make the best cake, throw the best party and take the best family photos with your perfect children. The problem with this is that mothers are already stressed out about being “perfect”, and seeing others this way online does not help to alleviate this major source of stress.

## Attributions

As humans, we try and make sense of the world. Part of this has to do with the way we explain the cause of behaviours and events. The intereences we make about the cause of our own or another's behaviour are called attributions.

There are 2 types:
    - Situational
    - Dispositional

Situational says that behaviour is due to somethign about the situation or circumstance.

Dispositional says the behaviour stems from who someone is. 

When we fail, we can also suffer from something called Actor-Observer Bias (Watson, 1982). This refers to the tendencyu to attribute our failures to situational factors, and others failures to internal or dispositional factors. 

    "At the end of the day, we want to feel good about ourselves, and therefore we engage in thoughts and actions that are reflective of this goal."

### Funamental attribution error

According to fundamental attribution error (FAE), our gut response to when people do things is to assume that their behaviour is due to internal factors, or something about them personally (Ross, 1977). At the same time, we underestimate the power of external factors or the situation. In other words, we fall victim of FAE when we overemphasize dispositional attributes and underemphasize situational attributes when explaining the behaviours of others.

In the boss example on the previous page, according to FAE you are more likely to assume your boss is a jerk than think he is just stressed out.

The amazing thing is that we do the exact opposite when we explain our own behavior. We overemphasis situational attributes and underemphasize dispositional attributes when explaining our own behaviour.

Often we engage in the actor-observer bias because when we act, our own surroundings and circumstances are the focus. When others act, the people and what we see externally are the focus (Jones & Nisbett, 1971). This helps to explain why we engage in the Fundamental Attribution Error: we only know so much about others, and therefore rely on what we have access to.

Culture Differences in Attribution

If you were brought in a Western culture (e.g., Canada or the United States), you are more likely to make more internal explanations, or ones that are very self-focused (Watson, 1982). In contrast, if you were brought in an Eastern culture (e.g., Japan or China), you are more likely to be more sensitive to situations and focus less on the individual. Ultimately, this culture is more collectively geared, and therefore is not as self-focused.

### Belief in a just world

Because as humans, we like to feel good about ourselves, we also engage in what is called belief in a just world. An easy way to remember this Just World Phenomenon is to think of the saying “You get what you deserve”. The focus here is on good people and actions as being rewarded, and bad people and actions as being punished (Hafer & Begue, 2005).

While this may seem harmless, in some cases, the motivation to see the world as a just and fair place can lead to victim-blaming and discrimination (or negative and hurtful behaviours).

For example, research (Myers & Spencer, 2001) has found that people who endorse “just world” beliefs are also more likely to believe:

   - Rape victims must have acted seductively
   - Battered spouses provoked their beatings
   - Poor people don’t deserve better
   - Sick people are responsible for their illness

One research study (Zhang, Zhang & Zhu, 2013) found that Internet use for obtaining news information was negatively related to belief in a just world. Essentially, the more time spent online reading the news (compared to newspapers, TV, magazines etc.), the less likely people were to believe world is just!

According to Zhang and colleagues (2013) since the Internet often covers more information or news that is highly negative, Internet users are less likely to believe that good things happen to good people and vice versa. Do you think this is a good thing, or a bad thing? Why might it be useful to think that justice and fairness will prevail versus thinking the world is a scary and harmful place?

### Attributions and emotional cues

Emotions of others are a good cue and help us to make attributions about behaviour. Well, this is the case face to face at least. For example, if we see another person sad, we experience sadness (Dimberg & Thunberg, 1998). By sharing emotional states, it helps us to better understand and predict the intentions and actions of others. The emotional cues of others impact our interpretation of their behaviours.
Why Does This Matter?

Sharon Seline, who often exchanged text messages with her daughter, who was away at college. One afternoon, they ‘chatted’ back and forth, with mom asking how things were going and daughter answering with positive statements followed by emoticons of smiles and hearts. Later that night, the daughter attempted suicide. The signs of depression were there, but could only have been interpreted through face-to-face communications and the sharing of her emotional state. (Margalit, 2014)

### Repercussions of reactions

#### Venting on facebook

Did you know that you can be held liable for what you post online? This doesn’t just apply to you own posts, it also applies to those that were shared or created by third parties as a result of your initial post!

Here is an actually court case that resulted from a woman posting information on Facebook about her neighbour:

It all started with incidents of "unneighbourly conduct" involving various noise, pet, and vehicle related disputes. The Defendant (woman) posted accusations “venting” on Facebook about the Plaintiff (high school music teacher). While this might seem pretty innocent, the Defendant went so far as to suggest the Plaintiff was a paedophile. Naturally, these accusations were false.

The scary part was that the Defendant (the woman) had over 2000 Facebook friends and her settings were public. This resulted in 57 replies to her posts and sharing by one other person who emailed the principal of the school that the Plaintiff (the music teacher) worked at.

The woman (Defendant) was charged with defamation, and had to pay $65,000 worth of charges (Hill, 2016).

### Attribution and Judgement via social media

In one study, researchers found that viewers make snap judgments based on profile photos, even if this contradicts text in a profile (Van Der Heide, D’Angelo & Schumaker, 2012). For example, after viewing a Facebook photo of a fellow student having fun with friends, participants rated the student as extroverted. The irony was that the profile owner explicitly posted that he was 'not a big people-person.'

The moral of this story is that, for the most part, we tend to focus more on the visual aspects of online profiles. The only exception, however, is when we see negative things posted. Then we pay closer attention to this information to form an impression.

A study conducted at Cornell university (Bazarova, 2012) examined perceptions of messages posted for various audiences. Specifically, both high and low intimacy posts were assessed. For example, a low intimacy post might look like this: “Maybe it’s time to put snow tires on my car”. A high intimacy post might look more like this: “The first snow of the year always makes me think of my childhood when I didn’t have so many problems to deal with.”

The researchers wanted to know how people perceive the appropriateness of each of these messages. What they found was that people typically preferred private disclosures of intimate content to smaller groups over public disclosures to larger groups.

In essence, we tend not to like or develop a good impression of those who share very intimate things with large public groups of users.

### Attributions and employment

Did you know that approximately 15% of current employees got first job through social media and that over 92% of employers use (or are planning to use) social media for recruiting (Jobvite, 2014)?

Statistics show that 65% of employers evaluate the personal character and integrity of potential employees based on social media pages (Messiah, 2012).

There is the possibility that employers will make positive attributions and develop good impressions of candidates based on what they find online. For example, some candidates may follow company postings on Facebook, tweets on Twitter and updates on LinkedIn. Employers then take notice of what they are looking at and commenting on their social media pages. Employers don’t just resort to the most common job sites such as Linkedin. In fact, they go to almost all the social media sites when screening for prospective employees (Brooks, 2016).

Just as a coin has two sides, there can also be negative outcomes associated with shared information online (Davidson, 2014). Is it proposed that you won’t get hired if you post:

    - Inappropriate or provocative photographs
    - Information about drinking
    - Information bad-mouthing a previous company or fellow employee
    - Discriminatory comments about race, gender, religion
    - Evidence of criminal behavior

The bottom line is that less than 1/3 of employers find content on social media that makes them more likely to hire a candidate (Perkins, 2015). More often than not, they find information that will lessen your likelihood of being hired. 

### Case Study: Emplyment appeal tribunal ruling

The Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) has ruled that a public corporation can legally fire an employee for posting inappropriate content online (no author, n.d.)

Scottish Canals, formerly a division of British Waterways, fired David Smith for inappropriate use of social media.

His bosses came across derogatory comments about managers and saw boastful posts about drinking while on the job. Mr. Smith argued he was joking and said he was unaware his posts were publicly accessible.

Here are some interesting quotes from employers that illustrate impressions made (Cooley & Parks-Yancy, 2016):

    Once [qualified applicant] has applied [for the job], I Google them right away. I want to see if their social media fits who their resume says they are. I also look at how their LinkedIn compares to, say, their Instagram. If it’s wildly different in a bad way, that’s a problem.

    I won’t even offer them an interview if they don’t have some type of social media presence… LinkedIn specifically. If you have a blocked profile, you are put at the bottom of the pile for interviews, because what are you hiding? Only a fool would not use social media for screening. That is a free way of assessing that person and who they really are.

    Not having a social media presence makes me question your integrity. What are you hiding? If you are looking a job, you should at least have a LinkedIn account. If you don’t, then I will ask a lot more questions than I normally would, and always check their references and their references’ social media. I just don’t feel good about people without a social media presence.

    I prefer married people, people with kids. They’re more stable, more likely to stay at the job. I can easily find that out by Google….all else being equal, I’ll hire married people over single people.

## Self Serving biases
Self-serving bias is the tendency to perceive ourselves favourably. The problem is that in doing this, we often fall prey to a variety of other faulty cognitive patterns or behaviours.

This relates closely to attributions, and doesn’t just apply to the positive aspects of the self. What happens when bad things happen to us? While we tend to attribute positive outcomes to oneself, when it comes to negative outcomes, we attribute these to other external factors. For example, student who do well on their exams are more likely to attribute performance to their own effort and ability. In contrast, those who do poorly on their exams are more likely to say it was an unfair exam or back luck.

One way to illustrate this bias is in sports. Athletes who win a game will often attribute the win to their own ability. Athletes who lose attribute the loss to external things, like bad refereeing or the other team’s dirty play.

Exposure to views that conflict with your own is a good thing, as it reduces prejudice and encourages thinking outside of the box, our need to be right and to stick with our current beliefs overrides the desire to be creative or more open-minded. And besides, as we’ll find out in this lesson, if you asked people if they thought they were open-minded and creative already, they’d probably say yes.

    Research shows that most people seek out and consider information that matches their opinions. (Chamorro-Premuzic, 2014)

### Above average

On nearly any dimension, most people see themselves as better than average (Mezulis, Abramson, Hyde & Hankin, 2004). People perceive themselves as, more intelligent, better looking, less prejudiced, and healthier than the average person. Consider some statistics:
    - 93% of drivers – even those who have been hospitalized for accidents – think they are safer and more skilled than average
    - 87% of MBA students at Stanford University rated their academic performance as above the median.
    - 68% of teachers in a survey of faculty at the University of Nebraska rated themselves in the top 25% for teaching ability.
    - 
When married people estimate how much of the housework each partner routinely did, they both think they did a greater proportion than their spouse thinks he or she did. For example, the wife might think she vacuums 75% of the time and that her husband vacuums 25% of the time. In contrast, the husband might think he vacuums 50% of the time and that his wife vacuums 50% of the time. When it comes to contribution, we tend to focus on what we do, not what the other person does.

The irony is that this doesn’t apply when it comes to conflict in relationships. We are self-serving here too, but instead, when it comes to blame, we as relationship partners are more likely to blame the other person for starting the fight. We tend to emphasize our own needs and hurt feelings, and may even go so far as to find reasons that excuse or justify our behaviour (Schüutz, 1999).


### Types of self serving biases

#### Unrealistic optimism

One way in which we think about ourselves positively by imagining that we will fare better in the future than their peers. This is called unrealistic optimism. Research has found this to be true across a variety of areas. For example, students perceive themselves as far more likely than their classmates to:

    get a good job
    draw a good salary
    own a home

One study looked at perceptions of marriage success and found that 137 marriage license applicants accurately estimated that around 50% marriages end in divorce. When asked their own chances of getting divorced, however, most of them assessed it as 0%

Being overly optimistic is not necessarily always bad thing. In fact, it has positive effects on health and well-being in some cases. In others however, being unrealistically optimistic can be dangerous. For example, if people think they aren’t at risk for contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI), they are also less likely to use condoms. This then puts them at a higher risk of actually getting an STI.

Another example of when unrealistic optimism can go wrong is when students are overconfident about an up-coming exam. In this case, they don’t prepare enough and as a result, end up doing less well than students who are anxious about the exam. 

#### False Consensus

Another self-serving bias that people show is called the false consensus effect. This is the tendency to overestimate the commonality of one’s opinions and one’s undesirable or unsuccessful behaviour. In other words, we tend to overestimate the percentage of people who agree with us on any issue.

For example, if I believe that Coldplay is a great band, I may leap to the conclusion that most other people feel the same way that I do. This applies to negative behaviours as well, as in the case of cheating. If we cheat, we may overestimate the number of other people who cheat too.

#### False Uniqueness

Although we are likely to use ourselves as a basis for judging other people’s opinions, as in the case of the false consensus effect, when it comes to abilities people are more likely to show a false uniqueness effect. This is the tendency to underestimate the commonality of one’s abilities and one’s desirable or successful behaviours.

For example, if you are a good piano player you might think that this is a very rare skill to have. In contrast, if you are also bad at math you might think this is very common.


#### Temporal Comparisons

In addition to comparing ourselves with others and viewing ourselves more positively, researchers have found that people also engage in something called temporal comparisons. This is a comparison between how the self is viewed now and how the self was viewed in the past or how the self is expected to be viewed in the future.

Now, you might think that you would want to look favourably on your past selves. So if you weren’t doing all that well in school right now, you might try and make yourself feel better by thinking about a time in the past when you were more successful. After all, who you were in the past should be a part of who you are in the present.

But, researchers have found that people actually choose to derogate or devalue their past selves in an effort to feel about themselves in the present. 

In one study, researchers asked participants to record either their best or their worst final grade of the previous academic term. Then, they had participants indicate how far away from the present that course felt to them. This was assessed by having participants indicate how far away the course felt on a 10-point scale with endpoints labeled feels like yesterday (1)and feels far away (10).

Results showed that participants felt farther away from the course in which they received their worst grade than the course in which they received their best grade, even after controlling for the actual passage of time. So, people appear to distance negative past events and keep their earlier successes close!

### Explainting the self serving bias

You might be wondering why we engage in this self-serving bias. Perhaps you have your own ideas about why this is the case. Research suggests that people are motivated to maintain high self-esteem. We are motivated to feel good about ourselves and therefore we will go out of our way to search for information that supports a positive evaluation of us.

Also, these biases may be a reflection of the way we process and remember information. That is, when we compare ourselves to others it requires that we first process, then remember and finally assess information. So, biases might just be a reflection of errors in how we interpret and recall information we encounter in our environment.


#### The Self-Serving Bias as Healthy

As mentioned already, we strive to maintain a high self-esteem. Therefore, the self-serving bias protects people from depression and buffers stress. Studies found that non-depressed people see themselves in more favourable ways than they are actually viewed by others.

Another way of looking at this is to conclude that depressed people are more accurate about their social surroundings, but as a result they are also sadder than non-depressed people.

#### The Self-Serving Bias as Unhealthy

People who blame others for their mistakes tend to be unhappier than those who acknowledge their mistakes. For example, when our mistakes are pointed out by others, we feel badly about ourselves. By engaging in the self-serving bias and by not acknowledging our own shortcomings, we may fall prey to this resultant negative outcome.

Another outcome may be an inflated judgment of one’s own group. For example, if we fail to admit our faults, we may think our social groups are better and more morally sound than they actually are. For example, sorority groups may see their own group as less snobby and conceited than other groups, when in reality this is not the case. Politics is another good example, where candidates will often point out the other candidate’s faults, but will fail to admit or brush off their own.

### Impression formation

At the end of the day, while we want to see ourselves positively, we also want others to see us positively. As we discussed in the lesson about the self, there is a reciprocal or bidirectional relationship between how we view the self and the feedback we get from others. We look to others as a source of self-understanding. So, impressions that we make on others are important. According to impression formation theory, global or general perceptions of others are formed based on basic qualities, behaviors and disclosed information.

As Malcom Gladwell (2007) said,

    “…the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and people is based on very narrow ‘slices’ of experience”

To reiterate, we form opinions and impressions of others quickly. These assessments are:

    Often below conscious awareness
    They are not intentional
    They are not controllable

The problem is, sometimes we make mistakes. In the case of online information, as mentioned, we remember more about our automatic “impression” of people online, than we do their actual profile information! This occurs because people sometimes don’t focus on important information. Instead, they assign too much weight to information that is obvious and superficial. Therefore, attention is paid to the information that allows for a quick and easy assessment. 

We also engage in what is called overgeneralizing. This cognitive bias is when we think that small amounts of information are highly representative. 

On the opposite end of the spectrum is oversimplifying. Think of the saying “Keep it simple stupid!” This bias is where we prefer simple explanations over complex ones – revert to what is easiest and fastest and make snap judgments that may or may not be accurate.

### Stereotyping

Stereotyping is a belief about the personal attributes of a group of people. Stereotypes can be overgeneralized, inaccurate and resistant to new information.

Some stereotypes are actually true. For example, older people are less active. According to sports statistics, African Americans are better at sports than Caucasians for the most part.

But, stereotypes can sometimes be overgeneralized. An example of this might be deciding you know exactly what someone is like from the colour of their skin. In this case, you’ve overgeneralized that all people with a particular characteristic might act or feel a certain way. In reality we are all individuals and skin colour alone does not dictate how we are as a person. 

Stereotypes can also be wrong. For example, we know that women are not worse than men at math. Instead, any noticeable differences are due to the fact that they have been socialized to believe they are, which leads to a behaviour consistent with this view. This can be very dangerous, because it sets us up for failure in some cases, simply because we have been told we are not as good. This invades our thoughts and can negatively affect our confidence, which then impacts on our performance.

### Online E-Impressions

Just like how we project and develop an impression of others in person, we also develop impressions of others based on information found online. This is called an e.Impression and is defined as the impression of an individual that develops based on information obtained through available online resources (Hanley, Farabee & Macan, 2010).

It is important to remember that an e.Impression does not necessarily include accurate information (Spon, 2017), just as face to face impressions can be inaccurate.
What Research Says

Research has found that e.Impressions are often dependent on information disclosed. For example, positive, negative, and private Facebook profiles can affect e.Impression in different ways.

124 participants assumed role of hiring manager read two candidates’ Facebook profiles and professionally equivalent resumés (i.e., these contained similar experience and education) profiles contained negative (e.g., pictures of drinking at parties), positive or private information

The participants then rated candidates based on their pre-interview impression- what they thought of the candidates. Impressions and the likelihood that they would be hired were lower when candidates had negative information in their profiles.

Interestingly, the worse the impressions were the harder the interviewer’s questions became. Specifically, questions were asked in a negative context, which made the interview process more difficult and therefore, the candidates were less likely to be hired!

#### Bragging online

In this article, an Australian woman shares a letter from friends attacking her bragging about her baby on Facebook. You will see that people generally don’t like when others brag and boast online, but unlike the women in this story, not all of us have the courage to say it! Here is the letter that was sent to her by her friends.
   
    Jade,
    I have got together with a few of the girls and we are all SO OVER your running commentary of your life and every single thing Addy does. Look we all have kids that we are besotted with – guess what – every parent things their kid is the best ever. But we don’t ram it down everyone else’s neck!! She wears a new outfit – well take a photo and send it PRIVATELY to the person who gave it to her – not to everyone!!! She crawls off the mat – we DON’T care!!!!! She’s 6 months old – BIG DEAL!!!! Stop and think – if every mother posted all that crap about their kid – I’m sure you’d get over it pretty quickly.

We know we tend to present ourselves positively online. While this may be innocent enough, we sometimes forget that others may view this and misinterpret our information.
Source and Focus of Content

One intriguing study found that the source and focus of social media profile content interact to inﬂuence impression formation (Scott & Ravenscroft, 2016). Specifically, when information was about the profile owner instead of someone else (e.g., a friend), it was perceived more often as bragging.

Ultimately, the less self-focused the information was, the more positively profile owners were viewed.

## Self Presentation

Sociologist Erving Goffman sought to understand how and why we present ourselves the way we do in different settings. He proposed that life is a stage, and that our day to day behaviour and identity was a continual performance (Goffman, 1978). 

Self-presentation is defined as the process by which we attempt to control how we are perceived by others (Leary, 1995). Typically, this involves what Goffman called idealization, whereby we tend to exaggerate or convey our most positive qualities to others. People will also selectively present certain information that they feel is desired by their particular audience (Goffman, 1978).

A large majority of our time is spent in the company of other people. Even when we are alone we even engaging in self-presentation. For example, you might be thinking about or rehearsing what you are going to say or do once in the presence of others. Another example is when you take one last look in the mirror before leaving the house. While this may not seem like self-presentation, you are checking to make sure you look a certain way based on what you know others expect.

### Self-Monitoring 

Imagine that you and another person are discussing musicians, and that the person tells you she liked a particular artist that you don’t like. What do you do?

There are three possible reactions.

    Say you also like that band, even though you don’t
    Express your true opinion and admit that you don’t like them
    Avoid conflict and perhaps change the subject

What research shows is that high self-monitors would more likely choose the first option as compared to low self-monitors.

High self-monitors are flexible people who strive to be the right person for every situation. They are also the social chameleons who change depending on the situation and may say or do things they don’t actually believe in. In contrast, low self-monitors are highly principled people. They value consistency between who they are and what they do and so they strive to be themselves in social settings. Because of this though, they may offend others by saying the wrong thing (Snyder, 1974).

### Why Self Present? 

Think about some instances in your own life when you have given someone a gift. How did they react? Were they happy and excited or did they fall flat in terms of their reaction? How did this make you feel?
Meeting Expectations

There are a variety of reasons why we choose to act in accordance with the expectations of others (DePaulo et al. 1996, Goffman, 1959). Some are listed here:

    Gain favours from others
    Gain social rewards (popularity, affirmation)
    Self-construction – adds to our identity
    Avoid conflict and tension in relationships
    Be liked by others

As social beings, we generally strive to avoid conflict. We also have a desire to belong and to be liked by those around us. This is called our need to belong (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). Therefore, certain types of self-presentational behaviours are motivated by a desire to avoid or reduce conflict or to be liked by others (DePaulo et al. 1996).

### Why is self presentation important?

How well we do in life all depends on how well we can convince others that we are worthy! Therefore, we need to create a positive impression (Hogan & Briggs, 1986). This impression may dictate who we marry, how many and the quality of friendships we have, and even the job we get.

We know that self-presentation is very important, but sometimes we engage in behaviors that might, on one hand, enhance how we are perceived while at the same time jeopardize our well-being (Leary, Tchividijian & Kraxberger, 1994).

Example: Cosmetics

Think about cosmetics for instance. For interest’s sake, you can view some interesting figures related to the cosmetics industry opens in new window to gain a better picture of just how much revenue is generated. The thing about cosmetics is that we are choosing to put dirt and chemicals on our skin, in an effort to be seen as beautiful. So we are enhancing our beauty on one hand, and destroying it on the other.

Example: Smoking

Another example is smoking. Smoking is a health hazard and yet lots of young people smoke to be seen as “cool” by their peers. This self-destructive behaviours are very much motivated by self-presentational desires (Sharp & Getz, 1996).


### Self Presentation Strategies

#### False Modesty

Do you know someone who constantly says things like “ugh… I’m so fat” or “I’m so ugly” or even, “I’m so bad at this”, when in reality they are the thinnest, or prettiest/most handsome or even the best person at it that you know?

When people criticize themselves even though they don’t truly feel that way, they are engaging in false modesty. We do this to gain reassurance from others or to reduce performance pressure (Exline & Lobel, 1999).

#### Internal Bias

We often display lower self-esteem than we might feel privately (Miller & Schlenker, 1985).

In one study, two groups of participants were asked to write about an important success experience in their lives. There were two conditions:

    50% of participants were asked to put their name on the paper and they were told that they would read out their statement to the class.
    50% of participants were not asked to put their name on the paper and would not be required to read their statement to the class.

Results showed that students who thought others would hear their statement often talked about how other people had helped them achieve success. In comparison, students whose papers were anonymous rarely mentioned anybody else, and often talked about the fact that they had achieved the success on their own. These results seem to suggest that people may just thank others publicly to appear humble, when in reality they credit themselves for their successes.

#### Self Handicapping

Self-handicapping is defined as protecting one’s self-image with behaviours that create a handy excuse for later failure. For example:

    Procrastination
    Reduce your preparation for a task
    Give your opponent an advantage
    Don’t try as hard as could

It’s easier to have a reason to fall back on, than to admit that you were the cause of your failure.

### Self Presentation and Technology

Nowadays, with the availability and presence of technology and social media, we feel entitled to know other people’s business. Scandals get attention in this information-saturated world and celebrity gossip is becoming more and more popular. The idea of “civil inattention” is dying term. For example, in the past, politely ignoring embarrassing moments or information was the right thing to do. This, however, is no longer the case. Any opportunity to highlight and draw attention to awkward situations is scooped up, often by posting information online for the world to see.

We know that technology has a profound effect on a variety of areas within society. For example:

    Communication – email, Skype, social media, face time
    Politics – political rallies, fundraising
    Relationships – friendships, dating, family
    Education – classroom content, MOOCs, online learning
    Publishing – decline of paper newspapers, ebooks, blogs, wikis

Social media offer a perfect forum by which to self-present. Chatrooms for example, used to be text based and therefore it was very easy to self-present and blur the boundaries of self. With the emergence of social networking sites, which ultimately encourage truthful sharing, we can still manipulate what others see through selectively posting photos, posts and links.

Performance on a stage, like Goffman (1978) originally proposed is now done through “profiles, images and messages” on social networking sites. When self-presenting online, we tend to emphasize the positive aspects of our lives just as we do face to face. For example, we may choose to portray ourselves as popular, well-rounded and thoughtful (Chou & Edge, 2012; Qiu, Lin, Leung & Tov, 2012). Our self-presentation tendencies have not change, but the opportunities and stages have. We can now tailor our presentation of self to various audiences across numerous unique social media sites.

There are some particular strategies used when presenting oneself online:
    - Ingratiation
    - Self-Promotion
    - Exemplification
    - Modesty
    - Supplication
    - Intimidation
    - 

### Research

One study conducted by Sheldon (2016) found that high self-monitors were more likely to self-present on Facebook. For example, they were more apt to post their own photographs and like and comment on other people’s photos.

Visual content is crucial for creating an online impression (Ellison, Heino & Gibbs, 2006). Research examined what kinds of information teens post online and found that their posts adhered to gender stereotypes. For example, males were more likely to post “strong” photos or photos with muscles and flexed biceps. Females on the other hand, were more likely to post “attractive” photos, with seductive and suggestive dress. This reinforces the idea that we are on a stage, and choose to display or act in ways that are consistent with what we believe our audience (in this case society) desires.

Research by Carmon (2010) highlights how there is an inconsistency between our offline and online selves, depending on how we believe we should be viewed. Results showed that girls who described themselves as "smart" or "kind" offline, described themselves as "fun," "funny," or "social" online. Sadly, girls with low self-esteem were also more likely to describe themselves as “sexy” and “crazy” online. The diverging audiences in this case, seem to motivate young girls to portray themselves in seemingly opposite ways.

Another study investigated how truthful information as online. They found that 56% of teens post untruthful information. One common lie was about age, whereby they lied about being older than they actually were. Interestingly, this study found that males for the most lied more often online (Lenhart & Madden, 2007).

## Narcissism

Narcissism came from Greek myth and was named after the son of a river God, his name was Narcissus. Narcissus was a very attractive young man who set out looking for love. He eventually comes to sees his own reflection in the water and falls so in love with his own image that he gazes at it until he dies. The narcissus is also a flower that resembles a daffodil and grows along the edge of rivers and lakes. This flower is delicate and beautiful, just like Narcissus himself (no author, 2017).

While Narcissist Personality Disorder (NPD) can have some very serious and negative outcomes, subclinical narcissism is viewed as a lesser degree of clinical narcissism. While this type of narcissism is not detrimental enough for clinical diagnosis, it can still be somewhat destructive to the individual and others around them.

Subclinical narcissists have an inflated view of themselves, believe they are unique and special, and expect special treatment from others (but own nothing in return) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Narcissists are apt to take what others will give, but are less likely to give in return. Narcissists have a strong desire for social contact, but need others for attention and admiration. Because these types of individuals can’t regulate their own self-worth to the same degree, they rely on external sources for affirmation (Campbell, Rudich Sedikides, 2002).

Here is a list of tendencies and behaviours that characterize the narcissist personality (Buss & Chiodo, 1991; Raskin & Terry, 1988; Twenge & Campbell, 2009):

    Engage in exhibitionism (showing off) and attention-seeking behaviour
    Dominance and competiveness is the focus in social settings
    They think they are more physically attractive and intelligent than others
    Would rather by admired than liked
    Brag about achievements
    Value material goods that display status
    Seek out trophy partners
    Talk a lot about themselves
    Surround themselves by those who look up to them (entourage)

Subclinical narcissism can have short-term advantages. For example, these types of people may experience greater job opportunities and dating opportunities in the short term due to their ability to reflect a highly confident self.

There are some serious long-term disadvantages however. Eventually these people are viewed negatively, as they come to be seen as arrogant or hostile. Oftentimes this personality type can also be perceived as entitled and obnoxious (Spain, 2014). The initial attraction eventually wears off and people grow tired of the narcissist.

### Narcissism vs High Self Esteem

Narcissists:
    - Lack deep connection to others
    - Have a sense of self is driven by fear of failure or weakness

People with high-esteem
    - Value close relationships
    - Have a sense of self-worth is based on actual accomplishments

### The Narcissism Epidemic

Meta analyses of narcissism, which look at a large number of studies, (Konrath, O’Brien & Hsing, 2011; Twenge, Konrath, Foster, Campbell & Bushman, 2008), indicate that there is a(n):

    1. Increase in narcissism
    2. Decrease in empathy (sympathy for the misfortunes of others)

It is worthy of note that these findings also revealed that this trend has accelerated since 2000. Remember back to the lesson on the history of social media, and the emergence of Web 2.0. This timeframe coincides nicely.

A very eye opening study was conducted by surveying 37,000 US college students in between 1980 and 2008 (Twenge & Campbell, 2009). Researchers found that narcissism increased to the same degree as obesity, and that this rise in narcissism was faster in the 2000s than any other decade. For example, in data from 2006, 1 out of 4 college students reported narcissistic traits. Furthermore, 1 out of 10 (in their 20s) and 1 out of 16 (all ages) reported having experienced symptoms of the Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) or clinical levels of narcissism.

Studies are now showing that there is a generational increase in narcissism and entitlement. Twenge (2014) analyzed trends over time and found that:

    Fewer people now slow down in a school zone
    Fewer people observe the item limit in a supermarket express lane.
    More people cut across parking lots to bypass stoplights
    In 1979, 29% of people failed to stop at a stop sign, in 1996 97% of drivers did not stop at all.
    In 2002, 74% of high school students admitted to cheating, up from 61% in 1992.

It is apparent that our behaviours and sense of entitlement seems to be changing. Let’s go through a few interesting research studies that further support this idea.

### Materialism and work

In a study comparing attitudes of three generations of high school seniors between 1976 and 2007 (Twenge & Kasser, 2013), researchers found that 62% of students said that lots of money was important in 2007 versus only 48% in 1976-78.
The same study (Twenge & Kasser, 2013) found that 25% of students said that work was important in 2007 versus 39% in the 1970s.

In an article in Time Magazine published in 2013, young people were asked about attitudes towards work promotion. They found that 40% of “Millenials” (i.e., born between early 1980s and early 2000s) believed they should be promoted every two years, regardless of performance.

These results suggest that entitlement is on the rise (which is part of the narcissist personality), with more value being placed on making money, and less on work ethic and hard work to support salaries and promotions. 

In 2011 DeWall and colleagues published a paper in which they analyzed lyrics in pop music produced between 1980 and 2007. They found that there was an increasing narcissistic focus or, in other words, more egotistical song lyrics. The focus shifted from we, our and us, to me and my. It is suggested that popular song lyrics mirror cultural changes in personality, traits, and motivations, with a shift to a greater absorption with the self.

### Possible Causes

#### Parenting?

According to an article published by People Magazine, children are increasingly being allowed to make their own decisions (Fields-Meyer, 2004). For example, one mother talked about her 10-year-old and how they let him decide whether or not to go to school. Tantrums are another issue. Children pull these fits if they don’t get their way. Another mother tells about when her daughter was 4 years old, “At dinner time if I didn’t make her favorite foods, she would throw a fit, and I would fix it” (Weiss, 41). It seems as though parents are not setting appropriate limits as they did in the past and children are becoming more entitled as time goes on.

#### Are Social Networks At Home To Blame?

I have seen in my years of teaching numerous occasions where parents step in for their adult children to engage with professors, registrars and administrators. It always shocks me when I see a student standing behind their parents at the beginning of the year, and the parent is picking courses for the student.

Parental coddling, including lavish praising, has been put forth as another possible contributor to narcissist tendencies. Nowadays no one fails, and everyone is given a ribbon no matter how well they did. Everyone feels special, unique and capable, even in the face of opposing evidence.

The problem with this approach is that when children are given compliments for a skill they have not mastered or talents they don’t possess it works in the reverse of our intentions. These children end up feeling more insecure (Alvord & Grados, 2005). Perhaps this feeling of insecurity drives them to seek out affirmation from others and the narcissistic ball starts rolling.

#### Social Influence

Our society embraces self-admiration. You can see this exhibited in many facets of society. Look at tattoos for instance.

The following are photos of tattoos people have. Notice the words. In one, it says “self-made” and in another the individual goes so far to have the words “I’m So Fabulous” emblazoned on their chest.

#### Lack of self awareness

It seems like everyone is on their device 24/7 in our society. What is also becoming apparent is the overall lack of self-awareness. For example, talking out loud on cell phones in public or in inappropriate settings (washrooms, classrooms). People cross the street without even looking, because they are too absorbed in their phones. Some go so far as to have full on intimate conversations via face time in public settings (e.g., coffee shops). All of these behaviours seem to point in one direction: Our attitude is that self-importance is more important than almost anything else, including noticing what is going on around us.

#### Personality and technology

We often think of technology nowadays is the main reason why we are seeing this rise in narcissism. While the strength of the relationship is still under consideration as researchers grow to understand how technology and this personality type relate, we do know that social media sites reinforce, and in some cases even create, narcissist tendencies (Buffardi & Campbell, 2008).

Here’s why:

    It’s a convenient outlet for vanity
    Many sites are designed to encourage self-promotion
    Users can accumulate large numbers of superficial friendships
    Users can get the feedback they need and become the centre of attention

### Facebook and Narcissism

Not surprisingly, those who self-promote more online, are also more likely to show narcissistic behaviours (Kaufman, 2011). This makes sense when you think about the motivations of people who self-promote. They want other to focus on them and their information, and also may go to great lengths to attract this attention from others.

Researchers were interested in investigating how personality and self-esteem was related to the types of information users post online (Marshall, Lefringhausen & Ferenczi, 2015). To do this, they surveyed 555 Facebook users’ personality and self-esteem and looked at what they post in their profile.

They found that users with low self-esteem posted more frequent status updates about their current romantic partner. Interestingly, those who bragged about diets, exercise, and accomplishments in their profile, were also more likely to be narcissist. These users also received a greater number of ‘likes’ and comments.

These findings suggest that narcissists’ boasting may be reinforced by desire to self-promote and the attention they garner from users.

### Negative Outcomes of Narcissism

Narcissism poses threats to emotional and psychological health. Because social interactions can be superficial because narcissists use others as a source of self-enhancement and self-promotion, they may fall flat when it comes to developing quality relationships.

    Millennials are interacting all day but almost entirely through a screen… and are deeply anxious about missing out on something better
    (Time Magazine, 2013)

Have you ever found yourself without the ability to use your phone, or access social media? Did you find that you were anxious and worried about what you might be missing out on? Do you ever wonder if this constant obsession with posting about the self is actually contributing to feelings of loneliness and lack of real social connection?

Statistics on depression show that only 1% to 2% of Americans born before 1915 suffered from major depression. This statistic is unbelievable considering that these people have lived through the Great Depression and two World Wars! Today, however, the rates of depression are now approximately 15% and 20% (with some studies suggesting that this number is closer to 50%).

### Case Study: Revenge of the Insulted Narcissist

James Holmes (Twenge, 2012)
James Holmes was found guilty of killing 12 people and injuring 70 in a shooting rampage at a Colorado movie theater on July 20, 2012. He snuck out an exit door, propped it open, and returned with weapons and other gear. He also went so far as to set off several gas or smoke canisters. Holmes then opened fire on the theater audience, killing 12 and wounding 70. He will spend the rest of his life in prison for his crimes.

When investigators delved deeper into Holmes’ situation, they discovered that he failed his graduate school oral exams only a month before the shooting. While Holmes graduated from UC Riverside with honours, but his graduate research work was often substandard.

After being told for years he was smart and brilliant, he then found out that he wasn't actually anything special. It is proposed that this threat to his personality drove him to commit these horrendous acts of violence.

### Positive Outcomes of Narcissism

Self-Esteem and Discovery

For one, behaviours associated with this personality type are such that they encourage discovery of information about the self. Narcissists are self-promoting and likely to post more on social media. Consequently, they may also gain insight into who they are because they desperately seek the feedback from others.

Generosity

Because narcissists enjoy when others pay attention to them, they are also more proactive and generous, as long as their behaviours are visible.

You can probably remember the ice bucket challenge or various other fundraisers that have occurred and have been posted on social media. Due to the attention and acclaim received, narcissists are more likely to up the ante of generosity to be seen in a positive light. For example, they might be the first person to start the challenge, post the most messages promoting the event and garner many supporters.

The generosity extends also to donations. Narcissists donate more online if their donations are visible to others. For example, in the case of Go Fund Me, people can create fundraising events and efforts and can reach out to others for support. There is a running bar on the site that shows who has donated and how much has been donated. In situation would encourage a narcissist to self-promote via generous donations.

## Interpersonal relationships



Friendship is defined as: “State of being friends; friendly relation, or attachment, to a person, or between persons; affection arising from mutual esteem and good will; friendliness” (friends.com, 2017)

Our peers are those that we consider our “social equals” (Lewis & Rosenblum, 1975). For friendships and peer groups to function successfully, there has to be equal status and power among members. The other important ingredient for good friendships is behavioural similarity. When it comes to friendships, “Birds of a feather, flock together”. Similarities help initiative friendships and keep friends connected (Curry & Dunbar, 2013; Rubin, Lynch, Coplan, Rose-Krasnor & Booth, 1994).

As we grow, our peers become very important to us. Because of this, we see a shift around school age whereby children go from spending their leisure time with adults, to friends or peers (Ellis, Rogoff & Cromer, 1981).

Peers offer many insights into the self and the world around us. For example, peers have an impact on:

    Identity, moral judgement
    Sexuality and love relationships
    Perceived support and guidance
    Individuality & autonomy
    Knowledge of information about world
    Sense of popularity, status, prestige and acceptance
    Perceived social competencies

Importantly, our friends (even same sex friends) teach us how to be with close others. They teach us about intimacy, give and take, communication, compassion and caring (Bagwell, Newcomb & Bukowski, 1998; Connolly, Furman & Konarski, 2000). These skills learned from friends prepare us for successful adult love relationships.

### Five types of peer acceptance

There are five types of peer acceptance (Coie, Dodge & Coppotelli, 1982). These types fall on a spectrum of liking and disliking by peers. You may relate to having been in one or more of these types throughout school. 
    - Popular: Liked by many, disliked by few
    - rejected: disliked by many, liked by few
    - Neglected: Not liked or disliked, invisible to peers
    - COntroversial: liked by many, disliked by few
    - Average-Status: liked and disliked by a moderate number of people

Being “accepted” by peers has implications for emotional/social adjustment during adolescence and into adulthood. Making/having friends in childhood/adolescence is associated with:

    higher feelings of self-worth in adulthood
    better self-images in adolescence
    better school performance

Being rejected on the other hand, is linked to variety of negative outcomes, including:

    delinquency
    drug abuse
    dropping out of school
    aggression

Overall those who are rejected by their peers are at greater risk for psychosocial difficulties during adulthood.

#### School Shootings

    Almost all the killers studied appeared to lack social support, having no one to turn to when in trouble. They reject their peers, and they are in turn rejected -- alone in a psychological sense
    (Levin & Madfis, 2009)

Levin and Madfis (2009) studied mass murders at schools and concluded that the shooter(s) often experienced a catastrophic loss (e.g., break up or being fired from work). In some cases, parents may play a crucial role in pushing them over the edge (e.g., pressuring them to be successful). 

### Online friendships

Research has found that approximately 20% of users met new friends online, with some portion of those friendships migrating offline or becoming face to face friendships (DiGennano & Dutton, 2007; Wang & Wellman, 2010). Extremely easy to make new friends and maintain old relationships, and more often than not, it’s to connect with those met offline (Subrahmanyam, Reich, Waechter & Espinoza, 2008). For example, adding friends you’ve met to Facebook and then “Facestalking” or getting to know them more via their profile (Young, 2011).

How many friends do you think you can have while still putting in consistent effort and time?

According to Robin Dunbar, the golden number is 150. It is proposed that this is the number of people with whom we can maintain a meaningful relationship, whether in a hunter-gatherer society or on Facebook (Bennett, 2013).

Dunbar (2016) studied the results from 3,375 Facebook users aged 18 to 65 and found that users possessed on average 150 friends online. Out of these, approximately 4 friends were seen as dependable and 14 friends had expressed sympathy during an "emotional crisis“

Online friendships can present many opportunities for emotional support. When it came to feeling connected to friends 83% of users reported feeling more informed about what is happening in friends’ lives, and 69% said they felt social media helped connect them to their friends’ feelings.

In terms of gender, according to a Pew Study opens in new window , girls were more likely than boys to say they are more informed about their friend’s lives (40% vs. 26% boys) and friends’ feelings (24% vs. 16% of boys).

#### The good

As mentioned before, one of the function of peers was to offer support. A Pew Study opens in new window supported this notion, and found that girls (73%) were more likely to receive support via social media, as compared to 63% of boys. While girls received more support, boys were not at a loss, and the majority of boys also said they benefitted socially online. Overall, 68% of teens reported gaining support via social media during tough times.

#### The Bad

Children and teens have limited self-regulation skills and are especially susceptible to peer pressure. This may result in cyberbullying, cliques formed online and sexual experimentation (e.g., sexting) (Patching, Hinduja, 2006; Christakis & Moreno, 2009).

Cyberbullying is defined as “deliberate usage of digital media to communicate false, embarrassing, or hostile information about another person” (Ito et al., 2009). This is also the most common online risk for all teens, and in many cases, the victim of cyberbullying is also an aggressor. This is a peer-to-peer risk and can be very hard to track.

If you would like, read the story of Amanda Todd, a young teen who committed suicide because of intense cyberbullying. Warning, some of this content may be disturbing to some readers.

More than 50 % of teens report they had exchanged sexually explicit text messages, with or without photographic images, as minors. Many jurisdictions consider sexting among minors child pornography, a prosecutable offense, with jail time and sex offender registration (Strohmaier, Murphy & DeMatteo, 2014).

### To Friend or not to Friend?

Are you are worried about accepting someone’s friend request? What happens if you don’t really want to add them (e.g., Linkedin)? Do you worry when you notice you have been defriended? How do you feel?

Research finds that while there are no social consequences for “de-friending” strangers, it matters for friends and acquaintances! Often people take this personally, and see it as being done on purpose (Ito et al., 2009). It is similar to being removed from someone’s face to face life, and many people experience upset when this occurs online.

According to Ito and Colleagues (2009) “MySpace had a “Top 8” feature, in which users could rank the people that were most important in their life and separate them from the rest of their friends. This caused a lot of drama, because people would judge how important they were to someone else based on how they ranked, or if they made the ranking at all. An uneven ranking between two individuals could cause jealousies and question loyalties.”

### Reasons for Friending

    “[C]yber” relationships often arise because parents, out of fear for their children’s safety, no longer allow them to be “free range” to congregate in local parks, at malls, and on street corners…
    (Ito, 2009)

In fact, two-thirds (62%) of teens say they’ve shared their social media username with a brand new friend as a way to stay in touch.

There are many reasons why we friend people online, including to:

    connect with actual friends
    connect with acquaintances, colleagues, etc.
    avoid rejecting, save face, easier to say ‘yes’ (more important when reciprocity is required)
    look popular
    build fan base/audience
    track conversations of interest
    signal affinity with certain types of people
    expand network to meet more people

### Colliding Groups

How do you manage various different or distinct groups online? What strategies do you use?

There may be a case where you have numerous profiles, perhaps one that is visible to your parents, and another that is for your friends. It may be that cultural or familial expectations limit what people are willing to share online with their families, and therefore the interests and expectations of their family collide with the social requirements of other interpersonal groups.

### Online Dating

Online dating started in 1980s. At this point, sites were largely text based. Use was stigmatized and typically used by shy people who couldn’t meet people offline. More modern sites have evolved to now attempt to match users based on certain characteristics such as personality or interests (Scharlott & Christ, 1995).

Attitudes towards online dating are changing. Over a 10 year period from 2005 to 2015, 44% of respondents felt that online dating was a good way to meet people compared to 59% in 2015. Perceptions of usage have also changed over time. Users of dating sites are now seen as less desperate than they were in the past (29% in 2005 to 23% in 2015).

In the past, the average dating site user was around 40 years old. In the past two years, however, there has been a dramatic increase in users aged 18-24. In fact, this age group has almost triple in between 2013 and 2015. 

There are sites for Christians, Jews, vegans, goths, emos, vegetarians, vampires and prisoners…and even ugly people.

Is there anything wrong with having sites tailored to specific types of users? Some people seem to think so. Here is a short news clip from CNN about a billboard for an all white dating. What do you think?

According to the Pew Internet Study (2015), approximately 30% of those who have used online dating never actually go on a date with someone! When it comes to marriage only a small percentage (5%) of people marry who they meet online.

When asked if they seek advice or guidance from others about profile creation, 22% reported asking someone to help create or review their profile. Females were more likely to seek advice (30%) versus males (16%).

Believe it or not, using online dating is not related to income or education. People who earn modest salaries are online, and so are those who make a lot of money. The same goes for education, there are high school drop outs all the way to PhDs. In terms of gender, both males and females post profiles online, males tend to visit the sites more frequently. Not surprisingly, divorcees are 3 times more likely to online date, and make up almost one third (27%) of the entire online dating demographic.

Users have different reasons for online dating, but according to research here are the main motivators (Whitty & Carr, 2006):

    it is an alternative to pubs or clubs
    they are shy or reserved
    they felt they had no other option
    it is convenient
    it is more privacy than face to face

#### Stages of Online Dating

    1. Attention - First, in the attention stage, we must attract someone through subtle nonverbal signals (i.e. photo or creative name). The problem is that when you don’t have a photo, you are less likely to attract another person online.
    2. Recognition -  In the recognition stage, we let others or are notified by others that we have been noticed. This is the equivalent to online flirting where we may send or be sent winks, pokes or kisses.
    3. Interaction - In the interaction stage, you converse online mostly for the purposes of verifying information and potentially setting up a meeting face to face.
    4.  Face-to-Face meeting - During the face to face stage, daters determines if there will be another date. If they are compatible and there is chemistry, then chances are a future date will be arranged.
    5. Resolution - During the final stage, resolution, daters may decide to pursue things further and continue seeing the person. It is not unreasonable that at the beginnings of a face to face relationships, online daters still maintain an active online dating profile. Once exclusivity is established, daters may then decide to delete or no longer access their dating profile.

#### What users want

Age and Attraction

Christian Rudder (2014), one of the founders of the famous dating site OkCupid and lead of OkCupid’s data analytics team tracked trends from the site starting in 2009. What he found was astonishing.

For females, their chronological age corresponds fairly closely to the age of men who look best to them. What this means is that if you are a 40 year old woman online dating, you will be most attracted to a man around the same age.

For males however, this is not the case. Rudder found that a male’s chronological age was not at all related to the age of women they found the most attractive. In fact, men of all ages reported that women in between ages 20 to 24 were the most attractive. Even if a man is 50, he still claims to be attracted to 20 year old females.

Wooderson’s Law - The trend for males to be attracted to younger females, regardless of their chronological age is called Wooderson’s Law. Here, a man’s age and sexual aims are independent (one changes while the other does not) (Alterovitz & Mendelsohn, 2011).

#### Benefits of Online Dating

There are quite a few pros related to online dating (Hitsch, Hortaçsu & Ariely, 2010).

Access

Certain sites make it easier to look for and find a particular type of dater with a specific orientation or lifestyle. In addition, online dating provides access to daters for those who live in isolated areas.
Matching

Modern dating sites now guide daters in the right direction, increasing the chance of finding a more compatible partner. E.g., people who have kids already.

Convenience and Safety

Online dating sites now make it easier to “test out” potentials first in a relatively safe setting. If you find you are no longer interested in someone, you can simply delete them. Perusing and engaging with other daters now also requires less time commitment due to the frequency and accessibility of profiles.

There are many benefits to online dating, but unfortunately what we know is that 80% of online daters present an unrealistic image, whether this be related to height, weight or age. The interesting thing is that the older you are, the less likely you are to lie.

#### Online Deception: Photographs

Importance of Photographs

    Photographs were identified as the single most deceptive element of the person's profile.
    (Toma, 2008)

Even though we know that people may present false or inaccurate photographic information in their profiles, this element is very important.

On January 15, 2013 Ok Cupid initiated the “Love is Blind Day”. IN an effort to do something different, OK Cupid removed profile photos for a few hours at starting at 9am. During the few hours that the pictures were removed, there was a drastic dip in conversations started online (Rudder, 2014). In fact, new conversations started per hour dropped from around 30,000 to 4,000 during this time.

Main Discrepancies

There are typically two main discrepancies when it comes to photos in online dating profiles (Hancock & Toma, 2009).

    Related to physical characteristics, such as age, weight, hair color.
    Related to use of photographic processes, such as retouching, cropping, or hiring professional photographers.

Research has found that female photographs were less accurate (or more deceptive) (48%) compared to male photographs (15%). Female photos contain more physical discrepancies. They may display a photo that is much older and therefore conveys a younger age, hair style or skin appearance. Females also employ more photographic process discrepancies involving retouching and professional photography. The other interesting finding was that female photos were on average 17 months old, whereas male photos were only 6 months old.

#### Gendered Deception

Different Lies

Research has found that males and females tend to lie about different aspects in their online dating profiles. Here is a breakdown of these gender differences in deception (Hancock, Toma & Ellison, 2007; Hitsch, Hostacsu & Ariely, 2010; Toma, Hancock & Ellison, 2008).

Males

    Emphasize status – report 20-40% higher income
    Title – Embellish their job title and how many people they supervise
    Twice as likely as women to lie about height (22% up to 50% lied)
    Weight – subtract 1.5 - 8.5 lbs on average
    Age – 30% of men lied +- 2 years, but as much as 10 years!
    Lie about type of car they drive, where they have travelled and their financial status


Females

    Emphasized physical attractiveness
    Title – 32 % of women DEMOTE themselves
    Weight – subtract 1.5 - 8.5 lbs on average
    Age – 17% of women lie and round down to nearest 5 year increment (e.g., if you’re 38, round down to 35)
